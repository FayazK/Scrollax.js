For anything more complex, like using methods, events, accessing instance properties, ... use the constructor and work with the instance directly.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nLatest stable release:\r\n\r\n- [Production `scrollax.min.js`](https://raw.github.com/iprodev/Scrollax.js/master/scrollax.min.js) - 7KB, 3KB gzipped\r\n- [Development `scrollax.js`](https://raw.github.com/iprodev/Scrollax.js/master/scrollax.js) - 22KB\r\n\r\nWhen isolating issues on jsfiddle, you can use this URL:\r\n\r\n- [http://iprodev.github.io/Scrollax.js/lib/scrollax.min.js](http://iprodev.github.io/Scrollax.js/lib/scrollax.min.js)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nCan be found in the [docs](https://github.com/iprodev/Scrollax.js/tree/master/docs) directory.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nPlease, read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for this project.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
